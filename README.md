Intro to Repositories
This readme file is a brief sample for me to get comfrotable with the Github interface. 

Tomorrow I am starting my journey to becoming a software developer.  It's a very exciting prospect!  I will become proficient at JavaScript, Ruby, HTML/CSS to start and expand to other things as they are introduced. 

Wish me luck.
